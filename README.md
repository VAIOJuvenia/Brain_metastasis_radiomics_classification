# Brain_metastasis_radiomics_classification

This is the repository for codes and models for a radiomic study dedicated for classification of cancer origin of brain metastasis.

The following categories were included:
1. standardscaler for normalization of radiomic features (ends with ".bin")
2. trained models for different input modalities (ends with ".bin")

For the MRI modality, 
1. ‘0’ refers T1 gradient-echo post images;
2. ‘1’ refers T1 spin-echo pre images; 
3. ‘2’ refers T1 spin-echo post images;
4. ‘3’ refers T2 FLAIR post images; 

The work is currently under submission, thanks for your kind attention.
