# Brain_metastasis_radiomics_classification

This is the repository for codes and models for a radiomic study dedicated for classification of cancer origin of brain metastasis.

The following categories were included:
1. standardscaler for normalization of radiomic features (ends with ".bin")
2. trained models for different input modalities (ends with ".bin")

The work is currently under submission, thanks for your kind attention.
